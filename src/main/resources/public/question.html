		<p class="para">Due to how long Java has been around, almost any question you can imagine has already been asked, answered, indexed, and democratically perfected through upvotes on the Internet. It is seriously hard to stump a search engine with a Java coding problem. Java has a very rich API, and an incredible supporting open source ecosystem. There are tools upon tools for just about everything you would like to do. There's also an amazing community driven process that ensures growth in the right direction. Java is an Object Oriented language. It internally embraces best practices of object oriented design and strongly suggests that you learn and follow them. 
		<br/><br/>It also heavily promotes correct usage and many of the documented Design Patterns use Java as the language de facto. Understanding design patterns can lead to much more maintainable code. The IDEs available for Java will blow your mind. Due to its strong typing, you'll not only be notified immediately of errors, but you'll also be given suggestions that will refactor and reformat your code with clear explanations and extreme ease. After using them, most people wonder how they ever coded before. Java is running just about everywhere you can imagine. It's usually where most large applications end up due to its scalability, stability, and maintainability. There's also currently a gigantic push in the Java community to be the leader of the IoT (Internet of Things). And it's coming. Very fast. </p>

		<p class="para">The fact is, every language has strengths and weaknesses; yes even Java has a bunch of lacunae that get overlooked by programmers because of the truckload of benefits it brings to the table. As a programmer, it's important to compare Java with other programing languages so that you are able to choose the best language for a particular project.</p>
