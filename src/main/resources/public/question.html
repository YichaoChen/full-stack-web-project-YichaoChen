		<br/><br/>
		<p2>Due to how long Java has been around, almost any question you can imagine has already been asked, answered, indexed, and democratically perfected through</p2>
		<p2>upvotes on the Internet. It is seriously hard to stump a search engine with a Java coding problem. Java has a very rich API, and an incredible supporting open source</p2>
		<p2>ecosystem. There are tools upon tools for just about everything you would like to do. There's also an amazing community driven process that ensures growth in the</p2>
		<p2>right direction. Java is an Object Oriented language. It internally embraces best practices of object oriented design and strongly suggests that you learn and follow them. </p2>
		<p2>It also heavily promotes correct usage and many of the documented Design Patterns use Java as the language de facto. Understanding design patterns can lead to</p2>
		<p2>much more maintainable code. The IDEs available for Java will blow your mind. Due to its strong typing, you'll not only be notified immediately of errors, but you'll also</p2>
		<p2>be given suggestions that will refactor and reformat your code with clear explanations and extreme ease. After using them, most people wonder how they ever coded</p2>
		<p2>before. Java is running just about everywhere you can imagine. It's usually where most large applications end up due to its scalability, stability, and maintainability. </p2>
		<p2>There's also currently a gigantic push in the Java community to be the leader of the IoT (Internet of Things). And it's coming. Very fast. </p2>

		<p2>Java has been well accepted in various business & domains (banking, health care, nutrition, agriculture,  education, finance, telecom, biotechnology and many more).</p2>
		<p2>Java has got huge and best communicty from developers, researches, trainers, domain experts. Java may be blacking some areas. Hence it is still evolving without</p2>
		<p2>much loosing backward compatability.</p2>

		<p2>The fact is, every language has strengths and weaknesses; yes even Java has a bunch of lacunae that get overlooked by programmers because of the truckload of </p2>
		<p2>benefits it brings to the table. As a programmer, it's important to compare Java with other programing languages so that you are able to choose the best language</p2> 
		<p2>for a particular project.</p2>
